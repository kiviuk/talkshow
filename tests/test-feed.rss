You might find the solution to your next architectural headache, pick up a new programming language, or just hear some good war stories from the frontline of technology.

      <title>Programming As An Expressive Instrument (with Sam Aaron)</title>

      <itunes:title>Programming As An Expressive Instrument (with Sam Aaron)</itunes:title>
      <itunes:summary>Sam Aaron is the creator of Sonic Pi, one of the most unusual software platforms you&apos;ll encounter. It&apos;s a live-coding playground for making music. A tool that lets you write code that defines sounds and musical phrases, and build up a hole program that plays anything from a short bleep to a whole nightclub set. And Sam&apos;s creator has been using it live for years, weaving drum &amp; bass nights out of thin air, all driven by the Ruby-esque he writes.

In this episode we go through Sam&apos;s career path and design journey as we look at what it takes to make a programming language with enough expressivity and productivity to produce music at the speed of Sam&apos;s imagination.
